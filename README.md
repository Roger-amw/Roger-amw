👋 Hi, I’m @Roger-amw, bioinformatician with strong biological background.

👀 I’m interested in developing my skills on bioinformatics. Lately I finished my PhD project on Polygenic Risk Score analysis and I am waiting for the dissertation defense date.
  
🌱 I'm also familiar with human WGS, targetedSeq, metagenomics, RNAseq, smallRNAseq, genomes assembly.
    
💞️ Using R, python, bash and a bunch of open-source software for analysis, dockers, WDL/Nextflow for pipelines.
