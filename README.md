👋 Hi, I’m @Roger-amw, bioinformtician with strong biological background.

👀 I’m interested in developing my skills on bioinformatics. I’m currently working on Polygenic Risk Score analysis on human low-coverage WGS data.
  
🌱 I'm also familiar with metagenomics, RNAseq, smallRNAseq, genomes assembly.
    
💞️ Using python, R, bash and a bunch of open-source software.
